    <p id="intro">We are Star Coders. We are a group of colleagues who are working in the field of engineering and using it to help the farmers
        in whichever way we can.<br>
        This is our very first project in this field.We are very much obliged to help farmers of our country in any way we possibly 
        can.<br>
        So, our website will help you to know what kinds of plants should be grown according to the basic chemical structure of the 
        soil and provide you with suggestions regarding crops. It will also tell you the irrigation system to be used in it and the
        best chemical composition of a fertile soil.That will be helpful in telling farmers that which type of crop can be easily grown on 
        soil present in particular area .It will be directly connected to the saving of time and money of farmers.And also fertility of soil remains maintained.That can be a great contribution towards agriculture.
